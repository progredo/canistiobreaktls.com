    "text": "Istio Does HTTP\nIstio can do all sorts of useful things with HTTP traffic. It can make routing decisions based on request properties like hostname (or authority as it’s known in HTTP2), header values, query parameters, and so on. It can produce fine grained metrics and logs capturing details like request counts and HTTP and gRPC status codes. And it can enforce traffic policies, allowing or rejecting requests based on attributes like the HTTP method, or the claims present in a JWT, or the URI being accessed.\nHowever in order to do these things it has to be able to inspect the traffic."
